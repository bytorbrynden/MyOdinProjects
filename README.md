# MyOdinProjects
## A collection of my submissions to "[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)" projects.

Rather than creating individual Git repositories for each project that I submit to *TOP*, I made the decision to combine everything into one repository, for the sake of my own sanity.

As of 04/27/2024, each project will be located in a subfolder that is prefixed with the learning path that the project is/was a part of. For commits, I will do my best to prefix the initial commit message with something to help distinguish what project the commit belongs to. Additionally, each project folder contains its own README file to help explain anything that needs explaining.

Feel free to browse, and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns!
