# The Odin Project - Foundations Course
## Project: Rock Paper Scissors
In an attempt to jump back into the world of web development, I decided to work my way through "[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)". I made a personal commitment to follow along with everything included in the course, including all of the simplest projects. The next project, part of the Foundations Course, is to build an interactive calculator application.

This is the repository where you will find what I submitted for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns.

### Project Requirements
This is an outline of the project's requirements, as defined by The Odin Project.

 - Must contain functions for all basic math operations normally performed on a basic calculator.
 - Must include buttons for every possible input (numbers, operators, and actions).
 - Must include a display that updates as soon as a button on the calculator is pressed.
 - Calculator should not evaluate more than one pair of numbers at a time.
 - Round answers with long decimals to prevent display overflow.
