# The Odin Project - Foundations Course
## Project: Etch-a-Sketch
In an attempt to jump back into the world of web development, I decided to work my way through "[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)". I made a personal commitment to follow along with everything included in the course, including all of the simplest projects. The next project, part of the Foundations Course, is to build a DOM-based "Etch-a-Sketch".

This is the repository where you will find what I submitted for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns.

### Project Requirements
This is an outline of the project's requirements, as defined by The Odin Project.

 - Create 16x16 grid programmatically, push to DOM.
 - Change color of each position when mouse passes through.
 - Allow user to change size of grid.
